## Architecture

The architecture of this project is broadly divided into 3 divisions:

1. Frontend
2. Backend
3. Database

### Frontend

This division contains the endpoint the user will interact with. Following is the list of pages that are present in the frontend:

1. Home Page
2. About Page
3. Signup Page
4. Login Page
5. User Home Page
6. User Profile Page

### Backend

The API is designed according to the REST API and follows the best practices and guides. The server is stateless and the API is divided by the resources as specified by the REST API conventions.

### Database

For the database, we have used Postgres. Database is implemented using the following schema. To connect backend with the database, we used Sequelize.

## Collaboration

Collaboration was a big challenge, considering the diversity in region and timing. To resolve these we used various tools to help track and contribute to the project. For source code collaboration, we used Git and GitHub. For task management, we used Trello. For visual representation of the components and structure of the project and the interconnection between them, we used Miro.
